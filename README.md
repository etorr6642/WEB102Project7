## Notes

There were very little challenges for this project. The lab prepared me for the setup and I just had to develop the idea behind it and a way to make it stand out. I did have to do some research to find out how to change the background of a card to a color selected as well as how to develop a summary of each character based on the characteristics chosen by the user.
